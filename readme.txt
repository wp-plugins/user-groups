This plugin does one thing, and does it well: create groups and organize your users by that group.

== Description ==

### Group Your Users

* Add descriptions to user groups
* Assign colors to user groups
* View all users in a group
* Add users to more than one group at a time

The User Groups plugin does not modify user capabilities, limit access, or anything like that. This plugin does one thing, and does it well: create groups and organize your users by that group.

Works beautifully with the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rich-text-tags/">Rich Text Tags</a> plugin for adding WYSIWYG descriptions to the User Groups.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the User Groups plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create User Groups by going to Users > Groups
1. Add users to an User Group by visiting their profile page and selecting checkboxes of the groups you'd like to add them to

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
